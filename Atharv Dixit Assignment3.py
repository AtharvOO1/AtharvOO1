#Ans1: Functions are advantageous in our program as it reduces the chances of error and also reduces the need for duplicate code. Modifying a program also becomes easier.

#Ans2: The code in a function run when it's called.

#Ans3: A function is created with the def keyword. The def keyword is followed by the function name with round brackets and a colon.
#      For eg: def product(a,b):

#Ans4: A function is a block of code that has statements and does a particular operation.
#      A function call is used to execute the function whenever is required.

#Ans5: Thereâ€™s only one global Python scope per program execution.

#Ans6: The variable in local scope destroys.

#Ans7: The return value gives the value with its type. Yes, it can be used in expression.

#Ans8: The return value of the called function is undefined and gives nothing.

#Ans9: Global keywords can be used to make a function variable refer to the global variable.

#Ans10: The data type of None is NoneType

#Ans11: It imports the module named areallyourpetsnamederic.

#Ans12: It can be called with spam.bacon()

#Ans13: We can use exception handeling and use try & except in our program.

#Ans14: The try block test a block of code for errors while the except block handles the error.
